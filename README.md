# Icons viewer

## Overview

**Update**: Originally this started out as a Heroicons iconset viewer. Then I added other sets. So now the site houses multiple icon sets.

A frontend for the newly released [Heroicons iconset](https://github.com/refactoringui/heroicons) by RefactoringUI (Adam Wathan/Steve Schoger). It's designed to specifically to work with TailwindCSS sizing classes.

Built using Vue and Tailwind CSS.

Initial idea from: https://github.com/codex-src/heroicons-viewer
